It aims to be a very practical way to learn about Test Driven Development.\n\nOften when learning about unit testing we read articles or watch tutorials that use toy examples. These are great to introduce the concepts behind TDD, but fail to bridge the gap with the world code.\n\nIn this workshop the attendees will get the chance to work on an actual horrible codebase, a TODO list app entirely written between UIAppDelegate and its view controllers.\n\nWe'll start from there and make it into a more sane codebase, one refactor at a time. By doing this we'll practice our testing and refactoring muscles.\n\nTo keep the audience engaged we'll setup as pairs and \"play ping-pong\". One individual will write a unit test, the other the code to make it pass. For each incremental refactor one pair from the audience will present their solution, giving a chance to the group to compare and discuss it.\n\nScaffold code will be provided to bridge the gaps when necessary, the focus is in finding ways to write tests for existing code and then to make that code better, not to write yet another UITableViewDataSource.",

            "description": "Automated tests are important to maintaing a robust code base. However, conventional unit tests are often overly specific and only test an arbitrary subset of possible scenarios. Furthermore, they rarely serve as good documentation. Property based tests can help mitigage some of these issues by focusing on describing the relationship between inputs and outputs, and running those tests with a randomly generated set of values. It has been used successfully in functional programming languages for two decades and is now easily achievable in Swift using SwiftCheck, a pure Swift port of one of Haskell's most prominent testing libraries.\n\nIn this talk, Sebastian gives an introduction to property based testing using the SwiftCheck library. The focus is on familiarising the audience with the concepts of properties, generators and shrinking, and how to apply them to their own code to achieve more meaningful tests and better code coverage. Examples are given in Swift using the SwiftCheck library, but apply to other languages and QuickCheck-style libraries as well.\n\nSlides with speaker notes and sample code will be made available after the talk for further study.",

As iOS apps become more and more complex, the business rules and logic introduced into the apps grows. There's a need to be able to handle all of the rules in an app and make sure that the user experience is amazing and delightful. State Machines are a great tool to use when approaching problems that have intricite rules for navigation between parts of the app. This talk aims to equip the listeners with the knowledge around what a state machine is, how it solves problems and what it looks like in an iOS app.\n\nA State Machine is a pattern that allows for navigation between a finite list of states that are defined. By using a finite list of states, we are able to define precisely the users interaction with a part of an app and make sure that the user doesn't reach a point where they shouldn't be. The State Machine is then responsible for defining the possible transitions between the states. What happens before a state transition and what happens after a state transition. To achieve this, I will demonstrate the code that drives a State Machine and how it allows for and prevents the interactions. There'll be demonstration around how the state machines can be tested. There'll also be discussion around the tradeoffs between compile time and run time checks with regard to the usage of state machines and what the alternatives are.\n\nIn the end, I hope that the listeners will be able to take some of the following away from the talk:\n\n* Knowledge of what a state machine is\n* Knowledge of when a state machine should be used\n* Knowledge of when a state machine shouldn't be used\n* Ability to define a state machine in swift\n* Ability to translate theoretical ideas into solvable problems in iOS apps by using a state machine\n\nThis talk will encourage people to use the pattern appropriately and not be frightened when encountering them in the wild. My existing thoughts on the topic are written up as a blog post at https://mattdelves.com/technical/2018/05/05/state-machines.html\n",

            "description": "Cognitive accessibility has been described as the ‘last great frontier’ in accessibility and universal design. Aiming for a clean and simple design is commonly valued already in mobile software, and often this is probably the only step that is taken towards cognitive accessibility. This talk will cover two practical approaches to enhance cognitive accessibility in mobile software. Firstly, it will propose that instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, apps could provide a user setting that gives an overall control of the degree of complexity that an app will present. The talk will outline a practical example of this, including the app architecture decisions and code required to implement this into an existing app. A second approach to cognitive accessibility was used in an iPad app for inpatients in a brain injury rehabilitation service, where we implemented a novel authentication mechanism using inexpensive Bluetooth wristbands. The authentication mechanism was trialed over several months with a series of six clients of the brain injury service who were part of the initial pilot of this Rehab Portal app, using signal strength information from the wristband as an indicator of proximity to iPads mounted to the wall in a client’s bedroom. The primary take-home message from this presentation is there are practical cognitive accessibility opportunities in the design of mobile apps. The Rehab Portal project discussed in this presentation was supported by a seed grant (#3705718 / A582) from the Medical Technologies Centre of Research Excellence (MedTech CoRE), funded by the Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand.",

The primary use of phones today - communication, photography, education, games - is a reflection on how people have always utilised technology. Within this talk I am going to be looking at the most common ways that every day people use their devices, and talking about how these patterns of behaviour is reflected in ancient forms of technology.

            "description": "You have worked really hard developing this new app, sweating over every tiny detail in order to craft the most delightful user experience. As developers, we often think it's time to celebrate as we push that last commit towards feature-complete. However, many challenges and pitfalls lurk around that can disrupt the launch or even kill the app before it releases on the App Store.\n\nThis talk presents a cautionary tale of our experience when producing the Roundtrip app, an officially accepted learner logbook app in New South Wales. We are hoping to share our experience and lessons learned beyond Xcode and Sketch, before and after the launch. Fasten your seatbelt as we venture through the following challenges: external dependencies and APIs, trademark disputes, security concerns, marketing miscommunications, user education, technical support, and many others.\n\nIf you are planning to release an app soon, or keen to raise the bar of your apps for the highly competitive mobile app landscape, this session is for you.",

In the three years since that 1.0.0 release, it has gained more and more features, and the internal complexity to go along with them. For version 5, however, we realized it was time to rewrite the core of the library to enable further growth, new features, and greater scalability. In this presentation I will explore the reasoning behind this risky decision and how we were able to use our existing test suite to replace the core of the framework while largely maintaining compatibility for existing Alamofire users.",
